#+TITLE: creamy-theme for Emacs

** About

Creamy is a warm, minimal theme for Emacs designed to reduce visual noise and make long coding sessions easier on the eyes. It softens the harsh edges of typical syntax highlighting by stripping away excess color, leaving only the essential elements subtly emphasized. The result is a calm, focused editing experience, gentle on the eyes, yet readable and expressive where it counts.

I've used Creamy privately for years, refining it over time to suit my needs for clarity and comfort. Eventually, it felt right to share it with the community, and now itâ€™s available as a standalone theme.
